**ORGANIZE MORBIDITY DATA**

Pulling out the questions that I think pertain to the MOS-HIV, which is the HIV-oriented quality of life scale that contains mental health questions. There are a number of other questions in the survey that are not included here. Once I know the extent to which we need them, I will add them. 

The majority of the questions in this section are on the following scale: 1 = none of the time; 2 = some of the time; 3 = most of the time, 4 = all of the time. They are saved as strings and I would like to save them as numeric, so I also parse them below.

```{r}
moshiv <- morbidity %>% as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(health_l1 = L1_HealthStatus,
         pain_l1 = L2_PainPastThirtyDays,
         social_limit_l121 = parse_number(L121_HealthLimitSocialActivities_FreqID), 
         anxious_l122 = parse_number(L122_NervousAnxious_FreqID),
         calm_l123 = parse_number(L123_CalmPeaceful_FreqID),
         depressed_l124 = parse_number(L124_Depressed_FreqID),
         happy_l125 = parse_number(L125_Happy_FreqID),
         depressed_extra_l126 = parse_number(L126_VeryDepressed_FreqID),
         energy_full_l127 = parse_number(L127_FullLifeEnergy_FreqID), 
         energy_none_l128 = parse_number(L128_WithoutEngery_FreqID),
         tired_l129 = parse_number(L129_Tired_FreqID),
         energy_enough_l1210 = parse_number(L1210_EnoughEnergy_FreqID),
         weighed_down_health_l1211 = parse_number(L1211_WeighedDownByHealth_FreqID),
         discouraged_health_l1212 = parse_number(L1212_DiscouragedByHealth_FreqID),
         despair_health_l1213 = parse_number(L1213_DespairOverHealth_FreqID), 
         afraid_health_l1214 = parse_number(L1214_AfraidBecauseHealth_FreqID), 
         reasoning_difficulty_l1215 = parse_number(L1215_DifficultyReasoningDecisions_FreqID), 
         forgetting_l1216 = parse_number(L1216_ForgotThings_FreqID), 
         attention_l1217 = parse_number(L1217_TroubleKeepingAttention_FreqID),
         concentration_l1218 = parse_number(L1218_DifficultyConcentrationThinking_FreqID),
         lifequality_l14 = L14_QualityOfLife) %>% 
  select(TimePoint, ParticipantID, (starts_with(c("health", "pain", "social", "anxious", "calm", "depressed", "happy", "energy", "tired", "weighed", "discouraged", "despair", "afraid", "reasoning", "forgetting", "attention", "concentration", "life" ))))

```

Focusing on Mental Health Subscale in exploration below.  The original MOS-HIV uses a scale of 1-6, so scaling is different. 
Larger values --> better mental health. 

```{r}
mh_sub <- moshiv %>% 
  select(TimePoint, ParticipantID, anxious_l122, calm_l123, happy_l125, depressed_l124, depressed_extra_l126) %>% 
  left_join(fishers_only, by = "ParticipantID") %>% 
  left_join(mothers_only, by = "ParticipantID")

dim(mh_sub)  # 3782    9
head(mh_sub)


dim(mh_sub) #3779 observations
```

Confirm that we don't have people who are both male and female (fisher and mother)

```{r}

head(mh_sub %>% 
       filter(male == 1 & female == 1))
```



What does the time series look like? I already know the data are collected at different time points for mothers than for fishers, so I am going to look at them separately.

```{r, results = "hold"}

fishers <- mh_sub %>% 
  filter(male == 1) %>% 
  group_by(TimePoint) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) 

mothers <- mh_sub %>% 
  filter(female == 1) %>% 
  group_by(TimePoint) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) 

fishers
mothers


```


Recoding key variables:
Recoding TimePoint into a numeric series for easier plotting.
Recoding anxious and depressed variables so that higher number is positive state.

![Mental Health Subscale survey questions](../images/mh_subscale.png) 

```{r}
# recoding TimePoint
# table(fisher_mh$TimePoint)
# 
# fisher_mh <- fisher_mh %>%
#   mutate(period = recode(TimePoint,
#                          "0" = "1",
#                          "3" = "2",
#                          "6" = "3",
#                          "12" = "4",
#                          "18" = "5",
#                          "24" = "6",
#                          .default = "99"))
# 
# table(fisher_mh$period)

mh_recode <- mh_sub %>% 
  mutate(depressed_l124 = recode(depressed_l124,
                                 "1" = "4", 
                                 "2" = "3", 
                                 "3" = "2", 
                                 "4" = "1"),
         depressed_extra_l126 = recode(depressed_extra_l126,
                                 "1" = "4", 
                                 "2" = "3", 
                                 "3" = "2", 
                                 "4" = "1"),
         anxious_l122 = recode(anxious_l122,
                                 "1" = "4", 
                                 "2" = "3", 
                                 "3" = "2", 
                                 "4" = "1"))


mh_recode <- mh_recode %>% 
  mutate(anxious_l122 = as.numeric(anxious_l122), 
         depressed_l124  = as.numeric(depressed_l124),
         depressed_extra_l126 =as.numeric(depressed_extra_l126))
```

For each fisher at each time point, we need to combine the five subscale variables to create and scale the sub-scale.

```{r}

mh_recode <- mh_recode %>% 
  mutate(total = (depressed_l124 + depressed_extra_l126 + anxious_l122 + calm_l123 + happy_l125))
         
minn <- 5
maxx <- 20
mh_recode <- mh_recode %>% 
  mutate(mh_subscale = (100/(maxx-5)) * (total - minn))

```

Keeping only relevant variables, generating a period variable for plotting, and replacing NAs with zero for male/female binary vars

```{r}
mh_recode <- mh_recode %>% 
  select(ParticipantID, TimePoint, mh_subscale, male, female)

mh_recode <- mh_recode %>%
  mutate(period = recode(TimePoint,
                         "0" = "1",
                         "3" = "2",
                         "6" = "3",
                         "9" = "4",
                         "12" = "6",
                         "15" = "7",
                         "18" = "8",
                         "21" = "9",
                         "24" = "10",
                         .default = "99")) %>% 
  mutate(period = as.numeric(period)) %>% 
  mutate(male = replace_na(male, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(female = replace_na(female, 0))

```


**VISUALIZE FISHER MENTAL HEALTH DATA**

Key takeaways from plots/tables below, as of 12/24/2021:

* The variation is not impressive. 
* The bulk of the sample is in the "some of the time" or "none of the time" categories, not "most of the time" or "all of the time". 
* The bulk of the movement seems to be between "some of the time" and "none of the time" too

Ideas for next steps: 

* What do mothers' mental health subscales look like? 
  * How different are they from fishers?
  * Are they collected at every time point?



Plotting fisher mental health subscale over time.

```{r}


mh_recode %>% 
  filter(male == 1) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = period , y = mh_subscale)) 
#ggsave("../images/mh_scatter_by_period.png")

mh_recode %>% 
  filter(male == 1) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = mh_subscale)) +
  facet_wrap(~ period)
#ggsave("../images/mh_histogram_by_period.png")

mh_recode %>% 
  filter(male == 1) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = mh_subscale)) +
  facet_wrap(~ period)
#ggsave("../images/mh_density_by_period.png")

mh_recode %>% 
  filter(male == 1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(period), y = mh_subscale)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Men's Mental Health Subscale by period")
ggsave("../images/mh_boxplot_by_period_men.png")

mh_recode %>% 
  filter(female == 1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(period), y = mh_subscale)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylim(0,100) +
  labs(title = "Women's Mental Health Subscale by period")
ggsave("../images/mh_boxplot_by_period_women.png")


```


I now want to know some summary statistics. What is the overall mean, the mean by period and the within-person mean. 
```{r, results = "hold"}

mh_recode %>% 
  filter(male == 1) %>% 
  group_by(period) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(mh_subscale), median = median(mh_subscale), sd = sd(mh_subscale)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Fisher MH subscale by period (Male)")

mh_recode %>% 
  filter(female == 1) %>% 
  group_by(period) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(mh_subscale), median = median(mh_subscale), sd = sd(mh_subscale)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Fisher MH subscale by period (Female)")

ggplot(fishers, aes(x = as.factor(period), y = mh_subscale)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Mental Health Subscale by period")
ggsave("../images/mh_boxplot_by_period.png")


mh_recode %>% 
  group_by(male) %>% 
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    mean = mean(mh_subscale, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd = sd(mh_subscale, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

ggboxplot(mh_recode, x = 'male', y = "mh_subscale", 
          color = "male", palette = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800"),
          ylab = "Mental health score", xlab = "Gender")

```




Quick calculation of within-household mean and SD. 
```{r, results = "hold"}
within_means <- fishers %>% 
  group_by(ParticipantID) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(mh_subscale), sd = sd(mh_subscale)) 
within_means %>% 
  summarise(mean1 = mean(mean), sd = sd(mean)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Within-fisher mean and SD")
            
```
